TO DO list for IMAGE app
==

script some tagging, eg:
- everything tagged crystallotus should also be tagged "psychedelic"  (see tag hierarchy below - avoid unnecessary duplication...)
- everything tagged  "Josephine Wall" should also be tagged "dreamy"


- image edit
 - image delete ( remove_image )
 - image replace (move the image info including tags to the new image, and remove the old)

tags
  - tag hierarchy
    - eg "crystallotus" should be under "psychedelic" - so that everything tagged crystallotus is also automatically tagged psychedelic
    - eg "Josephine Wall" (and all other artists) should be under "art"
    - eg girl,boy,man,woman, body parts, clothes worn should all be under "people"
    - BK tags (museum, gallery, Brahma Baba etc) should be under BK
    - sexual terms should be under "erotic"
 - (add and remove tag should really be passed by a POST form, not a GET url...)
 - edit a tag
 - listing by multiple tags
  - tag1 AND tag2
  - tag1 AND NOT tag2   
  - tag1 OR tag2
  IDEAS:
     - store compound tag filters in a "tagfilter" page, in python:
       - "tag1" and "tag2"
       - "tag1" or "tag2"
       - "tag1" and not "tag2"
     - name these in some distinct way (eg uppercase?) so that we can use them like a single tag, when listing/viewing etc..
       - eg REALGIRL = "girl" and not ("sims" or "3D")
           - in URL: <host>/12345?tag=REALGIRL
